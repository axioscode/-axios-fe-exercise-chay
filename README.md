# todos
- Body of site moves on mobile. I fixed this at some point, but some element is causing it to not stay fixed.
- Was in the middle of styling the chevron arrows and the carousel layout on the page. From my experience, I knew styling a packaged carousel always is a time sink, so I saved it for last.
- Responsive could be handled more cleanly. I'm repeating a lot of `isMobile` props all over the place.
- Colors/margins/fonts could all be made into constants and put into a config.
- Could pre-fetch the articles via `getInitialProps` and render the page with it, instead of waiting for the client to do it.
- I need to type the `getCarouselQuery` hook.
- Ran out of time to write tests for my hooks.
- Audit the interactions for accessibility and refine the semantic nesting.
